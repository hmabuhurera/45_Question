//13_Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”


let motorShoq:string[] = ["Bike", "Car", "Sport Bike", "Lambargni", "Bugati"]

motorShoq.forEach(car => console.log(`I would like to buy my own ${car}`));
