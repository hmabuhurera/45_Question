//12_Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let greetingFriend:string[] = ["Taha", "Sabahat", "Huzaifa","Mubashir","Sadiq"]

greetingFriend.forEach(print => console.log(`Have a Great in SAve Jurne ${print}`));
